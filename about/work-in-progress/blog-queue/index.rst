Not Yet in the Works

* Scheduling: the porting trap (plus link to it in
  :doc:`/blog/2011/01/porting-to-linux-there-s-always-a-better-way`,
  "Processes are Threads")
* Timers in Linux hehe!!
* ``html_sidebars`` not respected in RTD theme. How to fix that?
  Alternative solution, like inheriting a template?
* Document my own sphinx usage

  * really cool: ``make linkcheck``. goes out and sees if anybody's at
    home.
  * sidebar
  * admonitions
  * tables (!), cite examples like training material download matrix
  * Learned a lot from 

    * `Thomas Cokelaer's cheat sheet
      <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`__
    * `Documentation on Sphinx Site <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__

* ablog

  * doc roles have to absolute, apparently. couldn't figure out what
    the doc name was, at least.
  * ``conf.py`` pieces (especially that the atom feed is *silently*
    generated when ``blog_baseurl`` is not set).
