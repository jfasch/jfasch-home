**Why apply a software license to a website?**

This site contains material for courses that I give. The course
material is structured much like software (topics *depend on* other
topics; see for example :doc:`here
</trainings/material/soup/kernel/index>` and :doc:`here
</trainings/material/soup/python/group>`)

See also `this discussion over at LWN
<https://lwn.net/Articles/394306/>`__.

**Why not an Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license?**

Like with software that I write, I don't want anybody to make money
with my course material *without* giving modifications back.

I'm not a lawyer, but I understand that `CC BY-SA
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`__ permits exactly
that.

**Why not the `GNU Free Documentation License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html>`__**

A while ago, there was a `Debian resolution
<https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001>`__ to not use the GFDL
because it is *too* restrictive.

`This article
<https://web.archive.org/web/20080515215935/http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html>`__
describes pretty much the same issues.

Github
------

Progress is happening on `Github
<https://github.com/jfasch/jfasch-home>`__.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/jfasch/jfasch-home.git

Sphinx
------

Built with `the wonderful Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__
documentation generator. Homepages generally contain content, which is
not much different from documentation - so yes, Sphinx is a really
great static website generator. It lets me focus myself on content,
with an eye towards structure and built-in link consistency (it won't
let me break links by just moving documents around).

Work in Progress
----------------

Like any software, this is work in progress. That work is sloppily
tracked :doc:`here <work-in-progress/index>`.
