   * * Question
     * Yes
     * No
   * * The sysroot for the target system contains the cross compiler
       (an executable that runs on PC/Intel usually, and produces code
       that runs on the target architecture)
     * 
     * 
   * * The header files for the target are usually found in the
       sysroot
     * 
     * 
   * * The libraries that the sysroot contains contain code compiled
       for the target architecture
     * 
     * 
   * * The libraries that the sysroot contains contain code compiled
       for the architecture that the cross compiler runs on (usually
       PC/Intel)
     * 
     *
   * * A cross compiler runs on the target and produces code for the
       host system
     * 
     * 
   * * A cross compiler requires the host's header files to produce
       code for the target architecture
     * 
     * 
   * * The executables produced by the cross toolchain may run on the
       host only if the host architecture matches the target
       architecture
     * 
     * 
   * * A cross-linker combines target object code to build target
       executables

   * * Question
     * Yes
     * No
   * * C pointer arithmetic is the mother of C++ container classes
       management
     * 
     * 
   * * ``std::sort`` can operate on just a ``std::vector`` and a bare
       C array
     * 
     * 
   * * ``std::binary_search`` requires its range to be sorted
     * 
     *
   * * ``std::find_if`` requires its range to be sorted
     *
     *
   * * ``std::set`` maps keys to values
     *
     *
   * * ``std::set`` is a sequential data structure
     *
     *
   * * ``std::map`` is a sequential data structure
     *
