Exercise: Averaging Sensor
==========================

Goals
-----

* Look into *Design Patterns*. An averaging thermometer is a
  *composite*
* Learn how to use interfaces to *mock* functionality
* Look into *unit testing* and *test driven development*

Outcome
-------

* One or more *mocking* thermometer implementations
* An averaging thermometer that is configured to *have* (use?) a
  number of other thermometers to calculate the average temperature
  from
* A number of unit tests for the averaging thermometer
