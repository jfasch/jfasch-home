Arduino Implementation
----------------------

* Arduino: https://github.com/pololu/vl53l1x-arduino

Notes
-----

* There is a Linux implementation,
  https://github.com/mjbogusz/vl53l1x-linux, but lets not use that (it
  handles the address change operation in a way that we don't want).
* The device emits interrupts |longrightarrow| how could we make use
  of them?
* Linux kernel driver exists for VL53L0X
  https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/iio/proximity/vl53l0x-i2c.c

  User space access for that driver yet unclear, research needed
