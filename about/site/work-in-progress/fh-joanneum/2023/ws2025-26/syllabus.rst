Course Description
------------------

Scope and curriculum location
.............................

The course *Embedded Computing 2* takes place in the 5th semester of
the Bachelor’s degree programme Electronics and Computer Engineering
and has the following scope:

* 3 teaching units per week
* 4 ECTS credits

Course leader: Jörg Faschingbauer

Content
.......

* Object oriented programming in C++
* Linux systems programming
* Embedded linux: hardware interfaces (I2C, SPI, GPIO)
* Cross development 

Previous Knowledge Expected
...........................

Students are expected to have prior knowledge in the following areas:

* Computer Science and Programming 1
* Computer Science and Programming 2
* Embedded Computing 1

Objective
.........

The students

* know about the Linux OS system level concepts and interfaces
* know how to design system level software
* know how to use the features of C++
* know about OO design patterns
* can find their place in an existing project, should they be hired
  for that purpose

Teaching and Learning Methods
.............................

* Teaching

  * Frontal lectures at a minimum
  * Live programming by trainer, with explanations

* Exercises

  * Occasional exercises to settle frontal slide material
  * Project work (workpackages partly participate in grading)

Information On The Examination 
------------------------------

Assessment
..........

* Written exam at end of semester
* Exercises during semester course
* Project work, homework

Scoring
.......

The final grade is made up of the results of the partial performances
listed above as follows:

* 40% written exam at end of semester
* 60% exercises during semester course, project work, homework

The 60% share of the total is considered *practical work*. It is
gathered by performing project work (either in groups or alone), or by
passing occasional small exercises.

**Be aware that, though, that this score might be decreased by the
course leader if it turns out that you have been cheating.** This
might happen, for example, if you are using AI tools to generate code
for you **and not understand it**.

Grading
.......

The final mark is defined by the total score, using the following
scheme:

.. list-table::
   :align: left
   :widths: auto

   * * 91 – 100
     * Very good (1)
   * * 81 – 90
     * Good (2)
   * * 71 – 80
     * Satisfactory (3)
   * * 61 – 70
     * Sufficient (4)
   * * 0 – 60
     * Failed (5)

Allowed Resources For Written Examinations 
..........................................

None

Use Of Artificial Intelligence Assistance Systems
.................................................

During the practical part (project work) students are permitted to use
AI tools freely. 

.. attention::

   In case you use AI to generate code for you, **do make sure that
   you understand that code**. Otherwise it might well be that you are
   subtracted points from the score you already reached!

Repetition Options
..................

In the case of a negative assessment, the following options exist:

* Repeat only the theoretical exam (which contributes 40%) and reach
  as many of the 40% as are necessary to pass
* Do extra project work to gather practical points, thereby possibly exceeding the 60%

Whichever option is chosen/permitted depends on the severity of the
failure, and has to be decided by course leader and student.

The board repetition of an examination is always an overall
examination. However, thematic focal points can be set.

Examinations that have been passed can be repeated once. The
repetition of a positively completed examination must be reported to
the head of the degree programme within two weeks of the announcement
of the examination result. If several partial performances are to be
achieved, the course instructor determines which ones are to be
repeated. Registration for the examination is required for the
repetition. This repetition counts towards the total number of
examination attempts.

For each retake exam, only the grade of the retake exam counts.

Attendance Requirements
.......................

Students must attend at least 80% of the courses.

Attendance is compulsory for computer and laboratory
exercises. Exceptions are only possible in justified individual cases
(e.g. illness). In such cases, the exercises must be made up or
substitute work must be provided.
