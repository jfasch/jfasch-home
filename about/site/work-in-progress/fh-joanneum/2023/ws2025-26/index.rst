To Our Incomings
----------------

Please catch up on the following topics.

* Install a Linux of some kind. I (and Leo) suggest that you install
  WSL (use :doc:`this as an entry point
  </trainings/material/soup/linux/basics/intro/wsl>`), but there is
  also a VirtualBox image provided by a colleague (`Google Drive
  download
  <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AzsF4Mvh1HJ8k6OW5W5hQ5CF0HdqA51l>`__).

  * :ref:`fh-2025-04-07-homework`

* Shell usage and basic system knowledge

  * :doc:`/about/site/work-in-progress/fh-joanneum/2023/ss2025/2025-04-28/index`. This
    page consists of links to material that I assume. Focus on
    :ref:`shell usage <fh-2025-04-28-shell-usage>` and :ref:`permissions
    <fh-2025-04-28-permissions>`.
  * Do the exercise
    (:doc:`/about/site/work-in-progress/fh-joanneum/2023/ss2025/2025-05-06/index`)
    to verify.

* Prepare work environment.
