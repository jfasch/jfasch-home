Goal
----

A real motor that moves.

How
---

.. todo::

   Give information about the motor: links to documents, ...

* One PWM channel (see :doc:`here
  </trainings/material/soup/linux/hardware/pwm/topic>`) for the motor
  speed.
* One GPIO for the direction.

Testing
-------

The testing approach taken in :doc:`motor-gpio` sounds really feasible
to say the least. Lets continue it with this motor implementation.
