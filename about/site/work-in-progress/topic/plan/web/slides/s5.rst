S5 Integration
==============

`S5 <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/slide-shows.html>`__ is
a web presentation toolkit based upon `docutils
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>`__.

It is not integrated with Sphinx, which is the point of this task ...

* S5 comes with a set of themes of its own. Select a theme, and deploy
  that into ``_static/`` during build. From the generated slides,
  point links there.
* Embed build into Sphinx: make all Sphinx directives/roles work
  inside slide material.

   See :doc:`here </about/site/work-in-progress/topic/s5/index>` for
   how to generated S5 material manually.
