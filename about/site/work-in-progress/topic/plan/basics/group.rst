Topic Groups
============

**Non-goal**: visualization is not part of this task.

* Organize nodes/topics into groups. For example, the global "soup"
  has those groups (which in turn have subgroups):

  * Python

    * Basics
    * SW Development
    * Database/DBAPI2

  * C++

    * ...
    * ...

  * ...

* Back all that by unittests
