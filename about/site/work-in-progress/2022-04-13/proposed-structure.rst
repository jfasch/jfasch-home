* Python: pytest (sketch only)
* Livehacking and simple project

Block 3: TDD Hands-On
---------------------

* 7 people |longrightarrow| groups
* Artificial project; it's not easy to find code that can be made
  testable/tested at customer's site.
* cmake, cdash (?), ctest, visual studio (2019, doze)
* In-house tools for unittests?

  * cdk (core development kit) testsystem (home-made, unwanted
