09:00-09:15 Introductory Words
------------------------------

* This is not a tech seminar, but a psycho-social seminar
* Craftsmanship

  * Do we have rules?
  * Dont's?
  * Should we?

* How about that scenario (Robert Martin brings it during one of his
  talks) ...

  * Someone makes a dumb mistake and software kills 10000 people
  * Politics will jump in want answers
  * If we do not have one, they will regulate
  * Do we want this?
  * Ethics maybe? Do we have ethics?

   Every craft has rules

   This particular electrical installation does not seems to adhere to
   any rule.

   This is art

   It does not solve an immediate problem. There are software systems
   that look like this, though.

* Survey: who has had a project in their life that got out of control?
  Why?
