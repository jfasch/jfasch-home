Backlog: What Needs To Change, Or We Will All Die

Bugs

While :ref:`establishing the project <clean-code-establish-project>`,
there were a number of occasions where we though to ourselves, "WTF?",
but continued to hack at high speed. This is ok, as long as we gather
*refactoring* records into our backlog. 

See :doc:`bugs/group` for a number of records from that time.

Refactoring After Featuritis
----------------------------

The first feature that was implemented is
:doc:`features/csv`. Wreaking havoc on the code base, we shoehorned
that in, violating nearly every principle that defines our craft (see
:ref:`clean-code-solid`). Anyway, this gives us a chance to
deliciously and fearlessly clean up the code base after the fact.
