Use Case: Slide Show Material as Plain-Text Files
=================================================

As a training material editor, I want to be able to maintain slide
material as follows.

* *Version controlled*. This is best done when the source is program
  text or plain text.
* *No proprietary format* is acceptable. The entire project is about
  maintainability of a large base of training material. Slide formats
  like Powerpoint have proven to be of difficult maintainability.
