Use Case: Menu to Choose From
=============================

A training contains topics, possibly arranged in groups and
subgroups. Topics depend on other topics, and refer to even other
topics.

This is a structure that is not very transparent to the
unaware. Simply showing a graph is not helpful, although it contains
all information.

A customer who is interested in a training wants to see a good old
catalog of topics in "book" form. Chapters containing subchapters and
all that.

The information is there, and all that information can be computed.
