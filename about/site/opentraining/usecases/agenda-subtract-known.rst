Use Case: Custom Training, Subtract Known
=========================================

:doc:`agenda` lets one compose a custom training, given a number of
"entry point" topics. This is cool for a training where the audience
is totally new to, say, Python.

If they already have some experience, the trainer wants to *subtract*
topics (the basics) from the calculated graph.
