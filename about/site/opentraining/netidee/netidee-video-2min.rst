The Problem And Me
------------------

* Trainings all around Linux
* Large amounts of training material
* PDF slides, historically (created using `LaTeX Beamer
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)>`__)
* Not entirely satisfied (to say the least)
* Colleagues aren't satisfied with their material, either

Open Source Training Material
-----------------------------

**Why?**

* Nobody does it
* Trainers (even those in Open Source tech) *don't work together*
* ... although, historically, Open Source *software* has gained
  incredible momentum
* Expecting the same in training context

**How?** (This project)

* Define and implement common basis, solving a number of problems
* Provide in-depth documentation
* Provide representative examples |longrightarrow| my own training
  material
