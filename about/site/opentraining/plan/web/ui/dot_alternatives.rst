Clientside Graph Rendering
==========================

* Investigate Javascript graph rendering packages
* Prefer one that can do fisheye views
* Embed graph information into site, analogous to what's done
  currently with ``dot`` (from the `GraphViz package
  <https://graphviz.org/>`__) generated inline SVGs.
* Based upon that, implement the rendering.
