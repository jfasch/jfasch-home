Using Microsoft Teams on Linux
==============================

.. note::

   **TL;DR**: :ref:`back to X11 <desktop-sharing-x11-revival>`, and
   then :ref:`use Chromium <ms-teams-browser-app>`.

I frequently run :doc:`trainings </trainings/index>` for
companies. These trainings use to take place physically - I book hotel
and train for the duration of the training, meet people face to face,
have fun, and then travel home again.

Things have changed: it's the *Age Of The Corona Virus*, everybody's
working from home [#homeoffice_should_be_default]_, and the demand for
video conferencing solutions has grown dramatically. A customer,
having ordered a training end of March, has asked me if we could do
the training online - using Microsoft Teams [#teamviewer_experience]_.

I spent a number of hours to work out if and how that is done on
Linux, and to test all the details; this is what I want to share with
you in this post. It is sure not a definitive guide as I am not a
Microsoft expert [#driver_dont_tell_anybody]_, and things might have
changed as you read this. Please :doc:`inform me
</about/myself/index>` if you have news.

.. _desktop-sharing-x11-revival:

Screen Sharing: X11 Revival
---------------------------

First off: none of the methods described in the remainder works with
`Wayland <https://wayland.freedesktop.org/>`__. Wayland (and its
reference implementation, Weston) is intended to replace the X11
display protocol which has shown its age. Major distributions have
invested large amounts of work to make the switch, to the point that
Wayland runs really smooth nowadays. An X11 compatibility layer is
there to keep X11 applications happy.

Smooth - except for cornercases like X11 programs which want to share
the desktop, apparently. For Teams, this means:

* Teams is obviously an X11 program.
* The :ref:`native desktop app (the RPM installation)
  <ms-teams-desktop-app>` crashes hard when you hover over the "share
  screen" field.
* The :ref:`browser app <ms-teams-browser-app>`, from the sharer's
  point of view, appears to share like you tell it to. Meeting
  participants only see the mouse on a black screen, no matter what
  the sharer does.

So, here's how to make your login screen start an X11 session, rather
than a Wayland session.

In ``/etc/gdm/custom.conf``, a .ini style configuration file, you see
the ``[daemon]`` section, 

.. code-block:: console

   [daemon]
   # Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg
   #WaylandEnable=false
   #DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop

Switch to X11,

.. code-block:: console

   [daemon]
   WaylandEnable=false
   DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop

Log out (i.e. terminate the current Wayland session), log back in
(i.e. start an X11 session), done.

.. _ms-teams-desktop-app:

RPM Package (Meh!)
------------------

(I'm on Fedora; there's also a ``.deb`` available.)

Download the RPM from `here
<https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads>`__; it'll be available as
``~/Downloads/teams-1.3.00.5153-1.x86_64.rpm`` (your version might
differ) if you used a browser for the download. If you used ``wget``
then you know better where the file is.

Install it as root,

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo rpm -ivh ~/Downloads/teams-1.3.00.5153-1.x86_64.rpm

Start it,

.. code-block:: console

   $ teams

That was easy. Login with your Microsoft account, and figure out how
to use it (this is not the point of this post).

.. update:: 2020-04-09

   The following annoyances of the desktop app can be switched off in
   the settings; I should have checked more closely. See `here
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/comments/22019/view.html>`__,

Annoyance #1: Keeps Running in Background
.........................................

Call me old fashioned, but I like programs to quit when I tell them
to - especially when I know they use my microphone and camera. Teams
doesn't; it keeps running in the background,

.. code-block:: console

When I look at the ``SZ`` column of the ``ps`` output, that
:doc:`makes me wish </blog/2012/04/Why-ps-sucks>` it would really
stop. It consumes insane amounts of memory doing nothing.

Make it so,

.. code-block:: console

   $ killall teams

Check,

.. code-block:: console

   $ ps -efl|grep teams
   0 R jfasch     63500    1670 47  80   0 - 298385 -     17:41 ?        00:00:00 /usr/share/teams/teams
   0 S jfasch     63502   63500  1  80   0 - 98775 -      17:41 ?        00:00:00 /usr/share/teams/teams --type=zygote --no-sandbox

Blood pressure rising,

.. code-block:: console

   $ killall -9 teams

.. note::

   If I don't wipe it entirely with ``killall -9``, it comes back from
   time to time and says, "Please log in with your Microsoft
   account". *Cool feature, guys!*

Annoyance #2: (Re)Registers Itself For Autostart
................................................

Logout, and back in. Teams pops up right into my face. Maybe that's
the desired behavior in the office world where everyone's in a meeting
at any given point in time. I live in a different world though: when I
want something to pop into my face in the morning (I rarely do), I
configure it so.

.. code-block:: console

   $ rm ~/.config/autostart/teams.desktop

True, I could have edited the offending line of that file,

.. code-block:: console

   X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

But no.

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo rpm -e teams

.. _ms-teams-browser-app:

Run In Browser (My Recommendation)
----------------------------------

It turns out that Teams can run in the browser (thanks to `WebAssembly
<https://webassembly.org/>`__?). Really cool:

* I need not install a closed-source program (and let it access all my
  files)
* I need not blow it out of the water when my blood pressure rises
* It simply goes away when I close the browser tab
* Its security is that of the browser (if that's an argument)

Simply point your browser to
`<https://teams.microsoft.com/>`__. That's it.

Well, no, it's actually not so simple.

* It does not work with Firefox 74.0 (shipped with Fedora 31, as of
  2020-03-22). The error message says something like "DOM storage not
  enabled". I checked, DOM storage *is* enabled; this is where I gave
  up.
* It works in Chromium "Version 80.0.3987.132 (Developer Build) Fedora
  Project (64-bit)" (as it says) (shipped with Fedora 31, as of
  2020-03-22)
* Take care to run :ref:`X11 as explained above
  <desktop-sharing-x11-revival>` (to be able to share the desktop)
