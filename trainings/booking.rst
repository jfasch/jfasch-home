How To Book
===========

   * training@faschingbauer.co.at
   * :doc:`About myself </about/myself/index>`
   * :doc:`Course descriptions </trainings/index>`
   * :doc:`All course material (slides?)
     </trainings/material/soup/index>`

Please send an email training@faschingbauer.co.at, describing your
wishes. Cite course descriptions that you read :doc:`here
</trainings/index>`, list topics that you want included in a
training. The information need not be structured - just throw it at me
(:doc:`just call me </about/myself/index>`), and lets get in contact.

We'll then compose a training for you; this need not necessarily match
a :doc:`course description </trainings/index>`, but can be composed
from the :doc:`huge amount of course material
</trainings/material/soup/index>`. (Literally all courses that I give
are customer-specific; see :doc:`here for a list
</trainings/log/index>`)

All courses can be booked in an online setting [#basteln_nicht]_ too;
verified platforms are
 
* `Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`__
* :doc:`Microsoft Teams </blog/2020/03/ms-teams-on-linux>`
* :doc:`BigBlueButton </blog/2020/04/bbb>`

                    can be hard though.
