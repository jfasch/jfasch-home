Course Modes
------------

Onsite/Online
.............

Courses can be delivered in the following formats:

* **Onsite** for a single customer organization. Travel expenses are
  charged individually (usually I travel :doc:`from Graz/Austria
  </about/myself/index>`).
* **Virtual/online** for a single customer organization
  [#basteln_nicht]_. Verified platforms are
 
  * `Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`__
  * :doc:`Microsoft Teams </blog/2020/03/ms-teams-on-linux>`
  * :doc:`BigBlueButton </blog/2020/04/bbb>`

Delivery/Material
.................

.. sidebar:: See also

   * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/index`
   * :doc:`log/index`

All material is available :doc:`online from this site
</trainings/material/soup/index>`. Attendees are left with
:doc:`personalized writeups <log/index>` of their particular event as
it happened.

.. _course-pricing:

Pricing
-------

* The price for one course day is â‚¬1300.
* One day is typically around 8.5 hours (including breaks).
* Travel expenses, if any, are charged additionally (usually I travel
  :doc:`from Graz/Austria </about/myself/index>`)

Individual
----------

.. sidebar:: See also

   * :doc:`/trainings/repertoire/index`
   * :doc:`/trainings/log/index`
   * :doc:`/about/myself/index`

*Nearly all courses that I hold are composed individually.*
:doc:`Course descriptions </trainings/repertoire/index>` should be
seen as blueprints for courses that are rarely delivered in exactly
that form. Please browse :doc:`the course log <log/index>` to see what
a typical course looks like.

Please :doc:`come in contact with me </about/myself/index>`,
describing your wishes. Cite course descriptions that you read
:doc:`here </trainings/repertoire/index>`, list topics that you want
included in a training. The information need not be structured - just
throw it at me.

I'll then compose a training for you; this need not necessarily match
a :doc:`course description </trainings/index>`, but can be composed
from the :doc:`huge amount of course material
</trainings/material/soup/index>`.

                    can be hard though.
