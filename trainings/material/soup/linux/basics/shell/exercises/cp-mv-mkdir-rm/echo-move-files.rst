   * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/linux/basics/shell/file_dir_create_rm`
   * :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/linux/basics/shell/mv`

* Create two files ``garbage1.txt`` and ``garbage2.txt`` in your home
  directory (containing whatever you like)

  * Prior to doing this, use the ``ls`` :doc:`command <../../ls>` to
    verify that you don't accidentally overwrite existing files (you
    created - and should have removed - them in
    :doc:`echo-copy-files`)

* :doc:`Move <../../cp>` these files into
  ``/tmp/firstname.lastname/parent``

  * Do this using a *single* command
