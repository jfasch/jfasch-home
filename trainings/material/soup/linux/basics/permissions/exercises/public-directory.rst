Exercise: Create Public Directory
==================================

* In your home directory, :doc:`create a subdirectory
  <../../shell/file_dir_create_rm>` ``my-public-place``.

  You will use that directory to share data with your team mates.

* Tune that directory's permissions so that sharing is enabled:

  * You and your team mates can look and ``cd`` into it
  * You and your team mates can store data in it
  * You and your team mates can remove data from it
