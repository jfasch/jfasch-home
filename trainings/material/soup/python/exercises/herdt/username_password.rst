Exercise: Username/Password Check
=================================

Write a program that

* Uses the ``input()`` function to prompt the user for her username
  and password.
* Verifies the input against a username/password combination that
  you hardcode in the program.
* Outputs (to ``stdout``) either "Authentication successful" or
  "Authentication failed".
