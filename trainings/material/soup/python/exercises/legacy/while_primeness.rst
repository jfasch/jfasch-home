Write a program that checks whether a given number is prime!

The number that the program checks can be given in two ways,

* As a commandline parameter (for non-interactive use)
* Prompted from the user, using the ``input()`` function

.. note::

   A number is prime, if ...

   * It is not equal to 1
   * It is only divisible by 1 and itself
