#. Convert the program from exercise
   :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/exercises/legacy/while_primeness`
   as follows.

   * Use a ``for`` loop instead of a ``while`` loop
   * Use the ``range()`` function to specify the range of divisor
     candidates

#. Compare both ``while`` and ``for`` solutions. Which one appears
   more readable?
