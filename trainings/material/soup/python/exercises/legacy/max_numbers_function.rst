Modify the program from
:doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/exercises/herdt/max_numbers`
as follows.

* Push the code that calculates the maximum into a function.

  * The function takes the numbers-to-compare as parameters.
  * The function returns the calculated maximum.

* The rest of the program remains intact; only the function is called
  rather than implementing the comparison inline, top level.
