* *Object Oriented*

  * Classes/encapsulation, exception handling, ...
  * But not mandatory as in Java, for example

* *Interactive*

  * *Python prompt* |longrightarrow| Interpreter's *interactive mode*

* *For beginners*

  * Simple syntax: *indentation* instead of explicit block markers
  * Consistent
  * "There's only one way to do it!"

* *Powerful*

  * Advanced language features: Iteration, ``yield``, ...
  * Huge library |longrightarrow| "Comes with batteries included"
