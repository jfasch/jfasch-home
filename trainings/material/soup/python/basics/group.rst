Python's strengths are ...

* It is taught in no time (you'll find yourself writing useful
  programs on day two)
* It is powerful
* It comes with a huge toolkit (the *standard library*)

This course gives a thorough but easy introduction to Python. With the
help of many small exercises, you'll learn how to write Python
programs, get an overview of the functionality in the standard
library, and get an idea :doc:`what else <../advanced/group>` Python can do.
