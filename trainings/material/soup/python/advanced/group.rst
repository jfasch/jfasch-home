      * * **Requirements**
	* :doc:`../basics/group`
      * * **Target Audience**
	* Those who want to use Python as a programming (*not
          scripting*) language
      * * **Course Language**
	* * Course material language is English

What is missing from :doc:`../basics/group` is what makes Python a
language that is ...

* *interesting*
* *powerful*
* *beautiful*

To meet this goal, this course covers some advanced language features
which you won't be able to do without once you got used to them.
