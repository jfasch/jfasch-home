History
-------

* `Wikipedia
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)>`__
* "A record storing a function together with an environment"

  * That is pretty much it!

* Dates back to early functional languages

  * LISP
  * Scheme

Today
-----

* Also available in modern languages

  * Javascript
  * C++: explicit capturing in *lambdas*
  * C#

* Definitely not unique to Python

  * Although Wikipedia start out with Python examples
