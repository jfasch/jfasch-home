Visual Studio Code for Python Programming
=========================================

`Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ is not to be
confused with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code is actually a modern
text editor, not an IDE. Together with its configurabilty, it can be
turned into one, but by itself does not dictate anything upon the
user.

You trainer is only capable of using fancy editing frameworks in a
limited way (he's an Emacs addict, and he will use that editor during
live-hacking sessions).

That said, please be so kind as to watch the following tutorials on
using Studio Code for Python programming.

* A thorough one (by `Corey Schafer
  <https://www.youtube.com/c/coreyms>`__ who has a number of good
  tutorials)
