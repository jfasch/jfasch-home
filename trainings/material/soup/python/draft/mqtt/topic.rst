Starting the Service
--------------------

This is Fedorish, your mileage might vary:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl start mosquitto.service
   # netstat -antp|grep mosquitto
   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1883            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      53767/mosquitto     
   tcp6       0      0 :::1883                 :::*                    LISTEN      53767/mosquitto     

Ah, runs on port 1883.

See if it works. In one terminal, subscribe to a random topic. (Topic
are created as soon as they are mentioned.)

.. code-block:: console

   $ mosquitto_sub --host localhost --port 1883 --topic /random/topic 
   ...sit and wait for message...

In another terminal, publish a message,

.. code-block:: console

   $ mosquitto_pub --host localhost --port 1883 --topic /random/topic --message blah

You should see "blah" as the output of ``mosquitto_sub`` in the other
terminal.

Publishing a Message in Python
------------------------------

This is the easiest, so lets start with that.

.. literalinclude:: publish.py
   :caption: :download:`publish.py`
   :language: python

Run it, and in the terminal running ``mosquitto_sub`` you'll see
``"blech"`` on ``stdout``.

Subscribing a Topic in Python
-----------------------------

A little more complicated - we have to 

* run an *event loop*: we want to see more than one message coming in
* register a *callback* function that is called by MQTT to notify us
  about an incoming message

.. literalinclude:: subscribe.py
   :caption: :download:`subscribe.py`
   :language: python

Run it, possibly side by side with ``mosquitto_sub``. Publish a
message, using either the ``publish.py`` program above, or
``mosqitto_pub``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./subscribe.py 
   b'blech'

Message Payload?
----------------

Note the ``b`` in the output: what comes in is *not* a string. MQTT's
transport is encoding-free; what is sent is completely up to the
communicating parties.

You should probably read up on

* Encoding:
  :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/basics/python_0330_strings_encoding/topic`
* `JSON <https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json>`__,
  a popular transport format, used for MQTT message transfer, and on
  The Web which is full of it.
