Python: Project/Package Management

      * * **Duration**
	* 1-2 days (depends on previous knowledge)
      * * **Requirements**
	* * :doc:`../basics/group`
	  * :doc:`../advanced/group`
      * * **Target Audience**
        * * Lead programmers
	  * Architects
	  * Programming-affine managers
      * * **Course Language**
	* * Course material language is English
	  * Trainer language is English or German
      * * **See also**
	* * :doc:`Complete Python material
            </trainings/material/soup/python/group>`
      * * **Booking**
	* training@faschingbauer.co.at

While the focus of :doc:`../basics/group` and :doc:`../advanced/group`
is on *programming* and *using the language most effectively* (i.e.,
*fun*), this is not enough. Any nontrivial project also needs to
consider aspects that are not exactly that kind of fun:

* *Code quality*
* *Structure*
* *Packaging*
* *Dependency management*

This course covers these aspects by providing insight into Python's
rich set of non-fun tools.
