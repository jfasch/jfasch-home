Sample Trainings
----------------

Customers are usually left with :doc:`post-mortem course material
</trainings/log/index>` - a transcript of what has happened, relevant
links, and more. Here is a representative list of such transcripts,

* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2021-03-22/index`. Four days of Python,
  gradually advancing from :doc:`basic <basics/group>` to
  :doc:`advanced <advanced/group>` topics.
* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2020-05-18/index`. Single-person
  training in an online setting.
* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2020-10-19/index`. Four days of Python,
  with a number of excursions into the customer's domain, like `CAN
  Bus communication <https://youtu.be/5XuSr4M9uNI>`__
* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2020-09-07/index`. Very advanced;
  accompanied by a lot of improvised live-hacking.
* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2019-11-12/index`. Fun beating MATLAB
  with NumPy, for a team who wanted to know if that is possible.
