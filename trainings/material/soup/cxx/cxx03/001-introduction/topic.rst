Background
----------

**C is great**:

* One has control over everything
* Dominant language for years
* Real Men don't do Object Oriented Programming

**But** ...

* Same bugs over and over

  * Memory leaks and other cleanup
  * Dangling pointers
  * ...

* The need for inheritance was obvious even without language support

  * Implementation idioms were similar
  * ... but never the same
  * ... and always had to have too much code
