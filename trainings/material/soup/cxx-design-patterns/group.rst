To Be Done
----------

* Command with MTQueue
* Solution page(s) maybe?
* Fix proxy: proxy class points to interface, not to concrete class
* Clarify adapter!
* Pattern Catalog: Structural, Behavioral, Creational
* Interpreter: description in main page
* Observer

  * Description in main page
  * Exercise motivation, explain steps
