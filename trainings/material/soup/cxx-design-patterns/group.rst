.. ATTENTION: add items to both toctree and
.. list!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:

   uml/uml
   oo-principles
   singleton/singleton
   sensor-hierarchy
   adapter/adapter
   proxy/proxy
   decorator/decorator
   composite/composite
   command/command
   interpreter/interpreter
   observer/observer
   abstract-factory/abstract-factory
   heating-screenplay/heating-screenplay

To Be Done
----------

* Repertoire page

  * Pattern Catalog: Structural, Behavioral, Creational

* Source page

  * Solution page(s) maybe?
  * Link those into course page

* Command with MTQueue
* Course preparation page

  * Split project: base libraries and their tests
  * To-be-implemented things
  * List of files

* Fun exercise: devise a system where person have a sensor plugged
  into them. When the sensor sees a sign of sickness, a post is made
  into SocialDB to charge for it, and an observing party is notified.
