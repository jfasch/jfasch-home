.. ATTENTION: add items to both toctree and
.. list!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:

To Be Done
----------

* Source page

  * Solution page(s) maybe?
  * Link those into course page

* Move exercises into main pages
* Command with MTQueue
* Pattern Catalog: Structural, Behavioral, Creational
* Interpreter: description in main page
* Course preparation page

  * Split project: base libraries and their tests
  * To-be-implemented things
  * List of files

* Fun exercise: devise a system where person have a sensor plugged
  into them. When the sensor sees a sign of sickness, a post is made
  into SocialDB to charge for it, and an observing party is notified.
