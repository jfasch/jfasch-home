To Be Done
----------

* Source page

  * Solution page(s) maybe?

* Move exercises into main pages
* Command with MTQueue
* Clarify adapter!
* Pattern Catalog: Structural, Behavioral, Creational
* Interpreter: description in main page

* Course preparation page

  * Split project: base libraries and their tests
  * To-be-implemented things
  * List of files
