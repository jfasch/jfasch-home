To Be Done
----------

* Repertoire page

* Source page

  * Solution page(s) maybe?
  * Link those into course page

* Command with MTQueue
* Course preparation page

  * Split project: base libraries and their tests
  * To-be-implemented things
  * List of files

* Fun exercise: devise a system where person have a sensor plugged
  into them. When the sensor sees a sign of sickness, a post is made
  into SocialDB to charge for it, and an observing party is notified.
