Newer training material is written in `reStructuredText
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__, and massaged by a
Sphinx extension to form a network of *topics* as I call it. This is
:doc:`work in progress </about/site/opentraining/index>`.

The Python training has been converted to this format; :doc:`see there
<python/group>` for how this could look like (careful though: *this is
work in progress*).

   build the sample code that is referenced.
