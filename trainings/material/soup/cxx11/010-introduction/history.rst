**C++ is one of the ugliest languages in the world**

* Have to know C, including historical baggage

  * C preprocessor
  * No module concept
  * Implicit conversions
  * (*Many* more)

* No useful standard library
* Every new revision brings new features to solve old problems

The "New" C++
-------------

* Several years of development (since C++03)
* To be followed by C++14
* To be followed by C++17
* To be followed ...
* Focus

  * Easier usage (sometimes it reads like Python)
  * Performance
