  * Best text handling is not to
  * ``std::u8string`` is not Python ``str``

  * ``utf-16``: originally they though 16 bits would be enough for
    everyone (someone also said 640K would be enough)
  * still used as internal Windows and Java representation
  * ``utf-32`` never used, but often used internally to represent code
    points

  * Normalization: comparing two texts that are the same but under a
    different representation

    Bad: there is one code point to represent "Ã„", but it can alos be
    represented by "A" and one "modifier" that puts two points over
    preceding character.
