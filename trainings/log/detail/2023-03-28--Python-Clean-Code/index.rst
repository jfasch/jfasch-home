*Day 1:* Python Development: Select Topics
------------------------------------------

Knowing more about Python enables one to write ... well ... more code
in fewer lines. While that is not usually an attitude of programmers
that everybody loves, in Python there's a word for it: *Pythonic*. An
early PEP, `"PEP 20 â€“ The Zen of Python"
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/>`__ describes what that could
be. Lets have a closer look at what today's version of the language
offers in that respect.

Datatypes, References, Memory Management, Iteration

*Day 2:* Clean Code? (Software Development: A Craft)
----------------------------------------------------

Clean Code?
...........

What does `Robert C. Martin
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin>`__ mean?

From :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/clean-code/group`

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/clean-code/intro-python/livehacking`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/clean-code/craft-sw`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/clean-code/book-messages`

Unit Testing
............

No craft without testing. Again, automated testing is part of software
development for a long time now. Developers, and their employers
likewise, do not always recognize the goodness of non-immediacy.

Ease the technical hurdle, give terminology, discuss (unit tests as
documentation). The exercises in this training will be formulated as
unit tests, so maybe this chapter is in order right at the beginning
of it.

Design Patterns
...............

*Discussion*: so what? OO is there to solve problems in a readable and
reproducible way.

* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/cxx-design-patterns/uml/uml`
* :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/cxx-design-patterns/oo-principles`
* Pythonize *some* patterns (the simpler ones) from
  :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/cxx-design-patterns/group`. Maybe ...

  * Adapter
  * Proxy
  * Composite
  * Observer
