Discussion of Tasks
...................

* Sensors

  * LM73
  
    * :doc:`../soup/sensors/task-lm73-hwmon`; *Involves kernel build!*
    * :doc:`../soup/sensors/task-lm73-dev`
  
  * :doc:`../soup/sensors/task-ds18s20`; possible OneWire woes. 
  
    This task is performed by two groups. Maybe agree that one of
    those should proceed with the ``Switch`` interface instead? See
    :doc:`../soup/switches/group`.
  
  * :doc:`../soup/sensors/task-simu`. Point at
    :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/advanced/iteration-generation/topic`.
  *
    :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/FH-ECE-19/EC2/soup/sensors/task-arduino-proxy`. **The
    heavyweight!**

* Sensor Usage

  *
    :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/FH-ECE-19/EC2/soup/sensors/task-prog-stdout`. Point
    out that this task defines the sensor list configuration.
  *
    :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/FH-ECE-19/EC2/soup/mqtt/task-prog-mqtt`. point
    out that this task *uses* the sensor list configuration.

Exercise
--------

* Setup Pi (again?)
* Use ``ssh`` to connect to the Pi (:doc:`here
  </trainings/material/soup/devenv/ssh/basics>`)
* Mount your Pi homedirectory (:doc:`here
  </trainings/material/soup/devenv/ssh/sshfs>`)

TODOs
-----

* Add VSCode to Vbox image
* Topic: Raspi static IP, point to point connection to Linux PC (on
  subnet ``192.168.7.*``)
