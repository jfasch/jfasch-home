Group Project
-------------

* `Assignment sheet on Moodle
  <https://virtueller-campus-2021-22.fh-joanneum.at/mod/resource/view.php?id=27182>`__
* Show *Project Management*
* Git structure; see `Github project
  <https://github.com/jfasch/FH-ECE-19>`__

  * Sphinx, build
  * ``src/ece19``: point out that this is where we are working
    in. Last semester has been pushed down into ``summer-2021``.

* Next sessions

  * VO 2021-11-15
  * UE 2021-11-16

  Discuss consultation hours where I sit in FH for one day.

Discussion of Tasks
...................

* Sensors

  * LM73
  
    * *Temperature Sensor: LM73 (via hwmon)*; **Involves kernel build!**
    * *Temperature Sensor: LM73 (via i2c-dev)*
  
  * *Temperature Sensor: DS18S20*
  
    This task is performed by two groups. Maybe agree that one of
    those should proceed with the ``Switch`` interface instead?
  
  * *Simulated/Dummy Thermometers*. Point towards
    :doc:`/trainings/material/soup/python/advanced/iteration-generation/topic`.
  * Arduino/Raspberry Communication (Proxy Sensor)*. **The
    *heavyweight!**

* Sensor Usage

  * Program: Read Sensors, Write to stdout*. Point out that this task
    defines the sensor list configuration.
  * *Program: Read Sensors, Publish to MQTT Topic*. point out that
    this task *uses* the sensor list configuration.

Exercise
--------

* Setup Pi (again?)
* Use ``ssh`` to connect to the Pi (:doc:`here
  </trainings/material/soup/linux/ssh/basics>`)
* Mount your Pi homedirectory (:doc:`here
  </trainings/material/soup/linux/ssh/sshfs>`)

TODOs
-----

* Add VSCode to Vbox image
* Topic: Raspi static IP, point to point connection to Linux PC (on
  subnet ``192.168.7.*``)
