Sample Trainings
----------------

Customers are usually left with :doc:`post-mortem course material
</trainings/log/index>` - a transcript of what has happened, relevant
links, and more. Here is a representative list of such transcripts.

* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2022-11-07/index`. Five days
  tour-de-force, good clean fun in Python.
* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2020-10-19/index`. Four days of Python,
  with a number of excursions into the customer's domain, like `CAN
  Bus communication <https://youtu.be/5XuSr4M9uNI>`__
* :doc:`/trainings/log/detail/2019-11-12/index`. Fun beating MATLAB
  with `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`__, for a team who wanted to know
  if that is possible.
