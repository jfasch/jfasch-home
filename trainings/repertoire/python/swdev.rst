Course Outline
--------------

While the focus of :doc:`basics` and :doc:`advanced` is on
*programming* and *using the language most effectively* (i.e., *fun*),
this is not enough. Any nontrivial project also needs to consider
aspects that are not exactly that kind of fun:

* *Code quality* and *testing*
* *Structure*
* *Packaging*
* *Dependency management*

This course covers these aspects by providing insight into Python's
rich set of non-fun tools.

* Python Package Index (PyPI), and package installation
* Virtual environments
* ``setuptools``
* Unittesting (either ``unittest`` or ``pytest`` will be used)

Prerequisites
-------------

The attendees should be clearly Devops friendly, so to say, and fluent
on the commandline (can be learned in
:doc:`/trainings/repertoire/linux-prog/linux-basics`). Python
programming is sure helpful, especially as unit testing is part of the
course. (Can be learned :doc:`here <basics>`.)
