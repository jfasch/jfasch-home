`The Zen of Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`__
gives a number of reasons why it is a great idea to use that language
to solve problems.

Course Contents
---------------

* **Object Oriented Programming** The language is, in its internals,
  object oriented. Nobody is required to know what a class is though,
  although that knowledge sure helps maintain bigger code bases.

  * *Classes*
  * *Constructors*
  * *Members*
  * *Inheritance*
  * *Exceptions*
  * *The Python Object Model*

* **Modules and Packages**. The ``import`` statement, together with a
  simple yet powerful module concept, is the key to program
  modularization.

  * *Module search*
  * *Namespace packages*
  * *Relative imports*

* **Unit testing, structure, and sanity**. As projects become larger,
  they need help or they fall apart.

  * *Project structure*
  * *Package installation*: ``pip``, PyPi, and virtual environments
  * *Packaging*: ``setuptools``, and package deployment
  * *Unit testing*

* **Miscellaneous Topics**.

  * *Generators*: the ``yield`` statement, generator expressions
  * *Recursive interpreter calls*: ``exec()`` and ``eval()``
  * *Context Managers*: the ``with`` statement
  * *Decorators*
  * *Regular expressions*
