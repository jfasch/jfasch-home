Course Outline
--------------

What is missing from :doc:`basics` is what makes Python a language
that is ...

* *interesting*
* *powerful*
* *beautiful*

To meet this goal, this course covers some advanced language features
which you won't be able to do without once you got used to them.

Here is an outline of the course; see the :doc:`course material
</trainings/material/soup/python/advanced/index>` for more detailed
information.

* Object orientation: inheritance, interfaces, or only ducks?
* Exceptions
* Comprehension expressions: how to cram all in one line and still be
  readable
* The ``with`` statement: context managers
* Towards decorators: ``*args``, ``**kwargs``, and closures
* Generators/``yield``: ``for`` is (much) more
* ``eval`` and ``exec``
* Multithreading

Prerequisites
-------------

Attendees should have an understanding of basic python, as if they
went through the course :doc:`basics`.
