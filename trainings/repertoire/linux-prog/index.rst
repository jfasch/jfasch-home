Courses
-------

Linux has a set of strong concepts inherited from its UNIX roots, and
understanding these concepts is very helpful to everybody who writes
applications or otherwise gets in touch with software written for
Linux.

This series of courses covers these concepts from multiple viewpoints.

* :doc:`linux-basics`. An introduction to Linux on the commandline. As
  such, this course is not only for programmers (no program is
  written), but for everyone who wants to know more - e.g. testers,
  support personnel, ...

     linux-basics

* :doc:`sysprog/index`. All that is learned in :doc:`linux-basics` can
  be programmed - process creation, file IO, networking, and
  more. This series of courses covers exactly that: *The Linux API*.

     sysprog/index

* :doc:`kernel-programming-basics`.  The Linux Kernel implements the
  APIs that we use in :doc:`sysprog/index`. This course introduces you
  to a completely different world - the one that *implements* the
  world that we live in.

     kernel-programming-basics

* :doc:`embedded/index`. This course series provides an overview of
  how Linux makes it possible to operate with hardware - sensors,
  controllers, and the like. Also an emphasis is put on solutions for
  typical problems that resource constrained systems bring - realtime
  and memory management.

* :doc:`bash`. The shell that we use as a vehicle throughout these
  courses is also complete programming language. A little arcane
  though but also very interesting in that is reflects the UNIX
  concepts in every single corner. This course sheds light on how
  shell programming is done.
