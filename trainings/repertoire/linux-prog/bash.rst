The Bourne Shell is not only used to communicate with the system using
the commandline that it provides. It is also a full programming
language. This course gives insight into shell programming, exchanging
the first impression - *dirty!* - with the more appropriate second
impression: *aesthetic!*.

Course Outline
--------------

* **Some history** of UNIX and the shells which grew up together
* **Hello World** and other boilerplate
* **Variables, environment variablens, and commandline arguments**
* **Control constructs**. The bigger part of the course: conditionals
  and loops
* **Functions**
* **Pipes and IO-Redirection**
* **Miscellaneous**. String manipulation ("parameter expansion" is the
  correct term) and several other obscure constructs that one might
  not be able to do without

Prerequisites
-------------

Experience with Linux, especially shell commandline usage, is
required. See :doc:`/trainings/repertoire/linux-prog/linux-basics`.
