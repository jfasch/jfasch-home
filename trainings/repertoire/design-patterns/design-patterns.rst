Software in embedded systems is not generally known to be
overengineered. Embedded hardware, though, is becoming more and more
capable, and software has to follow suit. Internet connectivity, for
example, brings requirements of its own - there are entire new
dimensions of configurability and variability.

*Software Design Patterns* give names to a variety of methods that
software developers have used for decades, to attack the problem of
increasing software complexity and gravity. Though often associated
with overengineering [#luke]_, those methods solve real problems. This
course gives an overview of the problems, the methods, and most of
all, it establishes a common vocabulary.

Based on the classic book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusabe Object
Oriented Software" (nicknamed "Gang Of Four") jjj link, an overview of
the most popular patterns is given. While the book is a catalog of
patterns, the course gives a different view of the matter. With many
practical exercises, the focus is in recognizing problems whose
solution is described by a design pattern.

.. [#luke] While some say that polymorphism has been invented by the
	   indecisive, other say that architecture is the art of
	   making decisions late.
